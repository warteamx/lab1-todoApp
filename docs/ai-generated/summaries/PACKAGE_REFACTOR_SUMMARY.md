# Package.json Refactoring Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes the improvements made to the package.json files across the project to enhance organization, remove unused dependencies, and apply best practices.

## Changes Made

### 1. Root Package.json (/package.json)

#### ✅ Script Organization

- **Added organized sections**: Development, Testing, Linting & Formatting, Build, Version Management, and CI/CD & Release scripts
- **Added descriptive comments**: Each section has a comment for better navigation
- **Fixed script inconsistencies**: Corrected `npm -prefix` to `npm --prefix` for server scripts
- **Added new convenience scripts**:
  - `dev`: Runs both client and server concurrently
  - `test`: Runs both client and server tests
  - `lint`: Runs linting for both packages
  - `lint:fix`: Runs lint fix for both packages
  - `build`: Builds both client and server
  - `format`: Formats markdown, YAML, and JSON files

#### ✅ Dependencies

- **Added**: `concurrently` for running multiple commands in parallel
- **Enhanced metadata**: Added proper repository, homepage, bugs, keywords, and engines fields

### 2. Client Package.json (/client/package.json)

#### ✅ Script Organization

- **Reorganized scripts** into logical sections with comments
- **Added alias scripts**: `dev` as alias for `start`, `build` as alias for `build:web`
- **Improved naming**: Clear separation between development, build, testing, and formatting scripts

#### ✅ Removed Unused Dependencies

- **`aws-amplify`**: Not used in the codebase, using Supabase instead
- **`axios`**: Not used, using fetch/Supabase client
- **`react-native-gesture-handler`**: Not imported or used in any components
- **`react-native-reanimated`**: Not used for animations

#### ✅ Enhanced Metadata

- **Updated name**: Changed from generic "app" to "lab1-todoapp-client"
- **Added proper metadata**: Repository, homepage, keywords, engines, author, license

### 3. Server Package.json (/server/package.json)

#### ✅ Script Organization

- **Added organized sections**: Development, Build, Testing, Linting & Formatting, Logging, and Docker scripts
- **Logical grouping**: Related scripts are grouped together for better discoverability

#### ✅ Removed Unused Dependencies

- **`@types/swagger-jsdoc`**: Removed as swagger-jsdoc is not used in the codebase

#### ✅ Enhanced Metadata

- **Updated name**: Changed from generic "server" to "lab1-todoapp-server"
- **Added comprehensive metadata**: Repository, homepage, keywords, engines, author

### 4. CI/CD Updates

#### ✅ Updated GitHub Actions

- **Fixed build script reference**: Updated client build command from `build:web` to `build` for consistency

## Best Practices Applied

### ✅ Naming Conventions

- **Consistent prefixes**: `dev:`, `test:`, `build:`, `lint:`, `docker:`
- **Clear hierarchy**: Scripts organized from development to production use
- **Descriptive names**: Easy to understand what each script does

### ✅ Dependency Management

- **Removed unused packages**: Cleaned up dependencies that weren't being used
- **Kept necessary packages**: Retained all packages that are actually imported/used
- **Version consistency**: Maintained consistent versioning across packages

### ✅ Documentation

- **Added comments**: Script sections are clearly labeled
- **Enhanced descriptions**: Better package descriptions explaining their purpose
- **Metadata completeness**: All packages now have proper repository, author, and license information

### ✅ Developer Experience

- **Convenience scripts**: Added shortcuts like `dev`, `test`, `lint` for common workflows
- **Parallel execution**: Added `concurrently` for running multiple processes
- **Error prevention**: Fixed script command inconsistencies

## Dependencies Removed

### Client

- `aws-amplify`: 6.15.0 (117MB+ savings)
- `axios`: 1.9.0 (Not used, using fetch/Supabase)
- `react-native-gesture-handler`: 2.24.0 (Not used)
- `react-native-reanimated`: 3.17.4 (Not used for animations)

### Server

- `@types/swagger-jsdoc`: 6.0.4 (swagger-jsdoc not used)

## Dependencies Added

### Root

- `concurrently`: 9.1.0 (For running multiple scripts in parallel)

## Migration Guide

### For Developers

1. **Update local scripts**: Use new script names for better consistency
   - `npm run dev` instead of `npm run server:dev` + `npm run client:dev`
   - `npm run test` instead of `npm run test:client && npm run test:server`
   - `npm run lint:fix` for fixing linting issues across both packages

2. **Install new dependencies**: Run `npm install` in the root directory to get `concurrently`

3. **Remove unused packages**: The removed dependencies will be cleaned up on next `npm install`

### For CI/CD

- **Updated build scripts**: The GitHub Actions workflow has been updated to use the new build script names
- **No breaking changes**: All essential functionality remains the same

## Benefits

1. **Reduced bundle size**: Removed unused dependencies save significant space
2. **Better organization**: Scripts are logically grouped and well-documented
3. **Improved DX**: Convenience scripts make development workflows smoother
4. **Consistency**: Naming conventions are now consistent across all packages
5. **Maintainability**: Clear structure makes it easier to add new scripts
6. **Professional metadata**: Proper package information for better discoverability

## Future Recommendations

1. **Regular dependency audits**: Periodically review dependencies for usage
2. **Script documentation**: Consider adding a scripts documentation file
3. **Husky hooks**: Consider adding pre-commit hooks for linting and testing
4. **Package splitting**: For larger projects, consider splitting into workspaces
