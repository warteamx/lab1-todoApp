# Health Endpoint Implementation Summary

## Overview

Successfully implemented a health check endpoint at `GET /api/health` following domain-driven design principles and best practices.

## Implementation Details

### Structure

```
src/
├── api/health/
│   ├── health.controller.ts    # HTTP layer - handles requests/responses
│   ├── health.routes.ts        # Route definitions
│   └── health.openapi.yml      # OpenAPI specification
├── domain/health/
│   └── services/
│       └── health.service.ts   # Business logic layer
└── __tests__/health/
    ├── health.test.ts          # Integration tests
    └── health.service.test.ts  # Unit tests
```

### Features

- **Status**: Always returns "healthy" with HTTP 200
- **Timestamp**: Current ISO timestamp
- **Uptime**: Server uptime in seconds
- **Version**: Application version from package.json
- **No Authentication**: Health checks are public endpoints
- **OpenAPI Documentation**: Fully documented with Swagger UI integration

### Endpoint Response

```json
{
  "status": "healthy",
  "timestamp": "2025-08-14T09:37:39.005Z",
  "uptime": 167,
  "version": "1.1.0"
}
```

### Design Principles Applied

1. **Domain-Driven Design**: Business logic isolated in domain services
2. **Separation of Concerns**: Clear separation between API, domain, and infrastructure
3. **Simplicity**: Minimal, focused implementation without unnecessary complexity
4. **Testability**: Comprehensive unit and integration tests
5. **Documentation**: Complete OpenAPI specification
6. **Security**: No authentication required for health checks

### Files Modified/Created

- ✅ Created `src/__tests__/health/health.test.ts`
- ✅ Created `src/__tests__/health/health.service.test.ts`
- ✅ Updated `src/openapi.ts` to merge health API documentation
- ✅ Updated `src/app.ts` to include health routes

### Test Results

- ✅ All 9 health tests passing
- ✅ All 36 total tests passing
- ✅ No ESLint issues
